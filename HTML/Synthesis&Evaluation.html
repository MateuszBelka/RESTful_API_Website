    <h2 class="Heading">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="Content">In the "Synthesis &amp; evaluation" assignment we showed strong sides of our website, revealed problems that we encountered, analyzed comments from our TA and defined how we can improve our website to follow main guidelines. Our evaluation consists of 3 main parts: Introduction, Website's accessibility and mistakes and Appendices A(Guidelines' evaluation), B(Evaluation based on TA's comments). </p>
    <h2 class="Heading">Accessibility highlights</h2>
    <p class="Content">We have done our best to make our website convenient for using it for both workers and users. Our website provides a navigation bar on the top of the webpage including "Products", "Location", "Service", "For business" and information "About" our company. Our "Bestsellers" table provides forms such that it will be convenient for web-developers and workers to update products. At the end of our page, there is a link that jumps to the beginning of our page.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading">Improvement plan</h2>
    <p class="Content">Among all the improvements we have done, such as additional CSS tags that we missed in the first assignment and comments, describing the intention of each part of the code, we did not implement additional changes in our print version of the code. We believe that our print version alters the design of the page such that tables are located one below the other. Additionally, the general design of the website has been checked on print option in the browser to make sure that all elements of the website are properly displayed on the printed version. Therefore, we believe that our Print stylesheet has been properly adjusted for printing our webpage.</p>

        <td>HTML missing tag: h1</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Interactive form: no place holders and the submit button is outside the form</td>
        <td>Technical implementation detail. While working on the assignment 1 we didn't realize the proper way to position the submit button in relation to the form and the table in general. While working on assignments 2 &amp; 3 we had a chance to play a lot more around this part of our website and we understood the reasoning behind this feedback from TA.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CSS missing tags: background, border, border-width and font missing</td>
        <td>A negative aspect of our subimision. Addition of those tags would not only teach us how to better use short form tags in css but also would allow us to have more flexibility with the way our website looks like and our general ability to create more appealing design.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Print css style</td>
        <td>A negative aspect of our submission. Based on the TA feedback we were able to take a look back at our work and realize that our Print css stylesheet was not sufficient and we started thinking of ways to improve it.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Tables overlap</td>
        <td>A negative aspect of our submission. We decided to take on a challange of having two columns with each having a table that would properly react to changes in the screen resolution. Regardless on the fact that we were able to have this part of the assignment to work the way we intended on our machines, we learned based on the TA feedback that we haven't tested thoroughly our website and there was more bug fixing that we simply didn't see.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>No comments</td>
        <td>Technical implementation detail. Assignment 2 was a lot different from assignment 1 not only because the contents of our work are not directly visible to the user in the way in previously was but also the framework has completely changed. During this change back to traditional programming language we forgot to implement comments to explain how the code works as we subconsciously came in with the mindset that our work will not be visible to anyone. The feedback from TA reminded us that in real life transitions in companies happen all the time and being about to maintain someone elses code is crucial part of programming.</td>
